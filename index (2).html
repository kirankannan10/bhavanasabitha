           <h1><br><br>Cyberspace</h1>
           <p> <br>Cyberspace is a concept describing a widespread interconnected digital technology. "The expression dates back from the first decade of the diffusion of the internet. It refers to the online world as a world 'apart', as distinct from everyday reality.[1] In cyberspace people can hide behind fake identities, as in the famous The New Yorker cartoon." (Delfanti, Arvidsson, 150) The term entered popular culture from science fiction and the arts but is now used by technology strategists, security professionals, government, military and industry leaders and entrepreneurs to describe the domain of the global technology environment</p> <br>

                <p>Our shared point of departure was that we were working with physical settings, and we were both frustrated and displeased with the architecture from the period, particularly when it came to spaces for living. We felt that there was a need to loosen up the rigid confines of urban planning, giving back the gift of creativity to individual human beings and allowing them to shape and design their houses or dwellings themselves  instead of having some clever architect pop up, telling you how you should live. </p>

                <p>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.</p>

                        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
                        <p>In Norse cosmology, all beings live in Nine Worlds that
                            center around the cosmological tree Yggdrasil. The 
                            gods inhabit the heavenly realm of Asgard whereas
                            humanity inhabits Midgard, a region in the center
                            of the cosmos. Outside of the gods, humanity, and
                            the jötnar, these Nine Worlds are inhabited by 
                            beings, such as elves and dwarfs. Travel between
                            the worlds is frequently recounted in the myths,
                            where the gods and other beings may interact 
                            directly with humanity. Numerous creatures live
                            on Yggdrasil, such as the insulting messenger 
                            squirrel Ratatoskr and the perching hawk 
                            Veðrfölnir. The tree itself has three major
                            roots, and at the base of one of these
                            roots live a trio of norns, female entities
                            associated with fate.[28]</p>

                        <h2>Humanity</h2>
                        <p>According to the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda
                             poem, Völuspá, the first human couple consisted
                              of Ask and Embla; driftwood found by a trio of
                               gods and imbued with life in the form of three
                                gifts. After the cataclysm of Ragnarok, this
                                 process is mirrored in the survival of two 
                                 humans from a wood; Líf and Lífþrasir. From 
                                 this two humankind are foretold to repopulate
                                  the new and green earth</p>
